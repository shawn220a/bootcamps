# Module 17 Class 2: Confusion Matrices, Decision Trees, and Ensemble Learning

## Overview

We will pick up where they left off on Day 1 and determine the performance of machine learning models by using a confusion matrix. Then, we'll scale and normalize data across columns to avoid bias and use decision trees to make predictions. Finally, we‚Äôll learn and use ensemble machine learning methods &mdash; combining multiple models to help improve the accuracy, robustness, and performance of the model.


## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, we will be able to:

* Quantify and evaluate classification models by using confusion matrices
* Interpret confusion matrices and accuracy measures
* Use decision trees and random forests to aid the feature-selection process
* Apply bagging and boosting methods to create and use ensemble algorithms

## Instructor Notes

The activities in this class will complement Lessons **17.4.1: Assess Accuracy, Precision, and Sensitivity** through **17.10.3: Combination Sampling With SMOTEENN**. We will benefit from these activities if we‚Äòve progressed through these lessons, which cover the following concepts, techniques, and tasks:  

* Understanding, applying, and interpreting a confusion matrix
* Understanding and applying support vector machines
* Transforming categorical data to numerical data
* Scaling and normalizing data
* Understanding decision trees
* Applying a decision tree classifier model
* Understanding ensemble learning methods
* Applying a random forest classifier model
