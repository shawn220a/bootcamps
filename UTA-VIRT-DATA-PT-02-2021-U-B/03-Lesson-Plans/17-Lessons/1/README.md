# Module 17 Class 1: Introduction to Supervised Machine Learning

## Overview

This week, we will be introducing machine learning. In this unit, we will learn to prepare and transform data, split the data into training and testing sets, create a model and fit the model to the data, scale and normalize data, and then determine the performance of a machine learning model. We'll also learn and use ensemble methods &mdash; combining multiple models to help improve the accuracy, robustness, and performance of the machine learning model.

In today's class, we will use scikit-learn to prepare and transform data, split the data into training and testing sets, create a model and fit the model to the data, and use linear and logistic regression to make predictions based on test data.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, we will be able to:

* Create a machine learning environment
* Prepare and transform data
* Split data into training and testing sets
* Create a model and fit the model to the data
* Perform linear and logistic regression
* Make predictions based on test data

## Instructor Notes

* The activities in this class will complement Lessons **17.0.1: Predicting Credit Risk** through **17.4.2: Confusion Matrix in Practice**. Wewill benefit from these activities if we‚Äòve progressed through these lessons, which cover the following concepts, techniques, and tasks:  

* Creating a machine learning environment
* Splitting data into training and testing sets
* Fitting the model to improve accuracy
* Understanding and using linear and logistic regression to make predictions
* Assessing the accuracy, precision, and sensitivity of the model

* Creating a model, fitting or training the model to the data, and then using the model to make predictions has become the standard pattern that many machine learning libraries use. This common pattern eases experimenting with new algorithms and libraries when exploring machine learning solutions. We will learn that no single correct algorithm exists for any dataset or problem &mdash; and that experimentation and validation are often preferred. We will learn to quantify and validate the performance of many models to determine the one that best suits the needs of a given dataset.

**What is the relevance of machine learning?**

Machine learning is one kind of data analysis that automates model building, allowing us to create systems that can identify patterns, make decisions, and learn without much human intervention. It's an exciting realization of the power of artificial intelligence: as a computer learns from previous computations, it can produce reliable, repeatable results from previous decisions.

Although machine learning has been around for a while, recent years have seen a spike in its popularity. You can hear about it being used in Twitter marketing, in the recommendation systems that Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon use, and even in self-driving cars. The purpose of machine learning is to analyze more data in less time, delivering accurate results every time.

This branch of data analytics will continue growing in various areas: in the financial sector to identify investment opportunities, in government work to detect fraud, and in the advancement of wearable healthcare devices.
