# Module 1 Class 2: Deeper Dive with Excel

## Overview

In today's class, we’ll first walk through this week's Challenge assignment in office hours, and then the students will review VLookups, create line and bar charts, practice creating summary statistics, and add files to their GitHub repository.  

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Feel comfortable using GitHub.
* Create, modify, and stylize charts.
* Be familiar with the statistical terminology.
* Define and compute each of the three measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode).
* Identify outliers in data sets using summary statistics.

## Instructor Notes

* The activities in this class will complement Lessons **1.5.2 Measures of Central Tendency** through **1.6.1 GitHub**. You will benefit from these activities if they‘ve progressed through these lessons, which cover the following concepts, techniques, and tasks.

    * Determine the measures of central tendency: mean, median, and mode.
    * Determine the measures of spread: range, variance, standard deviation, and quartiles.
    * Visualize the distribution of data using Box Plots.
    * Using and adding files to a GitHub repository.
