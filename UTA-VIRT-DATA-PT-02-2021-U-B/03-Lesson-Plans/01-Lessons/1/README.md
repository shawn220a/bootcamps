## Instructor Notes

* The activities in this class will complement Lessons **1.0.1 Excelling with Excel** through **1.4.2 VLOOKUP**. We will cover the following concepts, techniques, and tasks:

    * Downloading and installing Excel
    * Downloading the `StarterBook.xlsx` for the module.
    * Filtering, formatting, and freezing specific columns and rows in Excel.
    * Adding conditional formatting to columns
    * Finding averages
    * Debugging errors
    * Using pivot tables and creating charts
    * Filtering a data set using `VLOOKUP()`.

* **This Week's Challenge:** For this week's Challenge, we'll be creating two charts: an ‚Äúoutcomes based on launch date‚Äù chart and an ‚Äúoutcomes based on goals‚Äù chart. For the ‚Äúoutcomes based on launch date‚Äù chart, you will need to create a Pivot Table that is filtered on a specific category, and for the ‚Äúoutcomes based on goals‚Äù chart, you'll need to use the `COUNTIFS()` function to filter the data on multiple criteria.
