# Module 9 Class 2: Working with Flask to Create a Web Application

## Overview

In class, you will learn to create a Flask web application, connect the app to a SQL database using SQLAlchemy, and render data onto a webpage.

The main focus of today's class is to have you connect to a SQL database using SQLAlchemy, retrieve data into Python objects using SQLAlchemy, create a Flask API web app,  connect the Flask app to a SQL database, and render the data onto a webpage.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, you will be able to:

* Connect to a database using SQLAlchemy
* Use Flask to create and run a server
* Retrieve data from a database using GET requests
* Execute database queries on behalf of the client
* Return jsonified query results from API endpoints and populate a webpage

<strong>📣  7.1 Instructor Do: Review </strong>

* These are the skills that were covered today:
  * Plotting data from a SQLAlchemy query was covered in **Lesson 9.3.4**.
  * Creating a Flask app was covered in **Lesson 9.4.3**.
  * Running a Flask app was covered in **Lesson 9.4.3**.
  * Creating API routes was covered in **Lesson 9.4.3** and **Lessons 9.5.3-9.5.6**.

* Please complete **Lesson 10.1.1: Install Your Tools** before next week so you won't have to install splinter, webdriver manager, bs4, and Mongo in class.
