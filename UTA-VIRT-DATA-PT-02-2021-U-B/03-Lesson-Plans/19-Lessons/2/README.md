# Module 19 Class 2: Applying Advanced Machine Learning to Real Data

## Overview

In class, we will practice adding more hidden layers and using different activation functions to increase the performance of a neural network. Then, we’ll apply a deep learning model on a real dataset, where we’ll preprocess, fit, transform, and split the data. Finally, we’ll train the model with more than one hidden layer and node, and then they’ll evaluate the model’s performance.  

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, we will be able to:

* Understand the differences between basic neural networks, deep learning, and other machine learning models
* Increase the performance of a neural network
* Apply deep learning to a dataset

## Instructor Notes

The activities in this class will complement Lessons **19.2.5: Create the Connective Tissue, the Multiple-Neuron Neural Network** through **19.6.2: For Best Results, Please Save After Training**. You will benefit from these activities if you‘ve progressed through these lessons, which cover the following concepts, techniques, and tasks:  

* Adding more hidden layers to a basic neural network
* Increasing a model’s performance using activation functions
* Practicing using one-hot encoding and data cleaning on a real dataset
* Applying deep learning to a dataset using the machine learning model workflow
* Adding a model checkpoint to save your model weights and resume training later
* Comparing basic neural networks and deep learning models to other machine learning models
