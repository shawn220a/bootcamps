# Module 19 Class 1: Introduction to Advanced Machine Learning

## Overview

This week, we will be introducing neural networks and deep learning. In this unit, we will compare the machine learning classification and regression models from previous modules with the neural network models used in this module. Then, we'll use TensorFlow to implement neural networks and deep neural networks across a number of different datasets, including image, natural language, and numerical datasets.

In today's class, we will review neural networks, the perceptron neural network model, and the components of a basic neural network. Then, we‚Äôll use the TensorFlow Playground to explore the components of a neural network and how each component interacts with others. Finally, we‚Äôll set up Google Colaboratory to execute ‚Äúcloud-based Jupyter Notebooks‚Äù and build their own neural network model.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, we will be able to:

* Compare the traditional machine learning classification and regression models with the neural network models
* Describe the perceptron model and its components
* Understand the concepts of a basic neural network
* Run cloud-based Jupyter Notebooks with Google Colaboratory
* Implement neural network models using TensorFlow

## Instructor Notes

* The activities in this class will complement Lessons **19.0.1: The Rise of Machine Learning** through **19.2.3: Train and Test a Basic Neural Network**.  You will benefit from these activities if you‚Äòve progressed through these lessons, which cover the following concepts, techniques, and tasks:  

* Understanding the concept of a neural network
* Understanding the concept of the perceptron model
* Using the TensorFlow Playground to understand a neural network and change its performance
* Installing TensorFlow
* Building a basic neural network
* Predicting the classification of data from a trained neural network


## Instructor Notes
These are resources to supplement your learning (but are not required to be watched or understood).

  * [But what is a Neural Network?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk) A fantastic introduction to neural networks and what they do.

  * [Hands-On in the Playground](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ru9dXF04iSE):  Interact with TensorFlow Playground step by step.
