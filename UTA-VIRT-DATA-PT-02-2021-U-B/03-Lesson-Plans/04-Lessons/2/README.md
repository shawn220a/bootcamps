# Module 4 Class 2: Data Munging and Manipulation

## Overview

In class, you will use Pandas to perform data munging operations and manipulate DataFrames to modify columns, remove or fill in missing data, group data into similar records to get sums and averages, and bin data.

In today's class, you will clean data, filter data based on conditions or values, group data into similar records to perform calculations on columns, create new DataFrames, and segment and sort values into bins.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, you will be able to:

* Drop missing values
* Delete and replace columns in a DataFrame
* Filter DataFrames based on a column or values in a column
* Segment and sort values into discrete bins

## Instructor Notes

* The activities in this class will complement Lessons **4.8.1: Set the Index to the School Name** through **4.13.2: Create a DataFrame for the Scores by School Type**.  You will benefit from these activities if you've progressed through these lessons, which cover the following concepts, techniques, and tasks:  

* Group data into similar records and perform calculations on the grouped data
* Filter a DataFrame based on a condition using logical operators
* Combine series to create a DataFrame
* Segment and sort values into discrete bins
* Format values in DataFrame columns
