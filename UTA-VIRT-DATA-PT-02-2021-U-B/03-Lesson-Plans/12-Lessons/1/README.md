# Module 12 Class 1: Plotly Basics

## Overview

This week, we will be introducing `Plotly.js`, a JavaScript visualization library. You will learn to use Plotly and JavaScript to create an interactive data visualization for the web.

In today's class, you will use Plotly to create basic plots. Then, you will transform your plots using the JavaScript `filter()`, `map()`, `sort()`, and `slice()` methods. Finally, you will use arrow functions to shorten the syntax of their functions.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, you will be able to:

* Create basic plots, including box and pie charts, with Plotly.
* Use the following JavaScript methods to transform their plots:
 * map
 * filter
 * slice
 * sort
* Create anonymous functions with the arrow function.

## Instructor Notes

* The activities in this class will complement Lessons **12.1.1: Organizing Your Tools** through **12.2.2 Practicing JavaScript Methods**.  You will benefit from these activities if you‚Äòve progressed through these lessons, which cover the following concepts, techniques, and tasks:

* Creating basic plots
* Adding data to a trace object
* Using `filter()`, `map()`, and arrow functions.
* Using the `slice()` and `sort()` methods.
