# Module 16 Class 2: ETL with Amazon Web Services

## Overview

In class, we will introduce Amazon Web Services, or AWS. We will learn how to store data on AWS Simple Storage Service, or S3, and use Postgres on their Relational Database Services, or RDS. We will also learn how to monitor costs and shut down services to not accrue anything on top of the free-tier plan.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, we will be able to:

* Create a database in AWS RDS
* Create buckets and load objects into S3
* Connect to the RDS with pgAdmin and perform Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) operations.
* Use AWS for ETL

## Instructor Notes

* The activities in this class will complement Lessons **16.7.1: Evaluate Amazon Web Services** through **16.9.3: Check AWS billing**.  We will benefit from these activities if we‚Äòve progressed through these lessons, which cover the following concepts, techniques, and tasks:

   * Using AWS
   * Creating a Relational Database in AWS
   * Connecting with pgAdmin to an RDS instance
   * Storing data on AWS S3
   * Retrieving data from S3 and performing ETL to load into an RDS instance.
   * Managing AWS billing.
