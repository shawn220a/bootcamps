# Module 16 Class 1: PySpark Fundamentals

## Overview

This week, we will be introducing **Big Data**. In this unit, we will learn about big data and Spark, an engine for large-scale data processing. We will use the Python version of Spark, PySpark, to manipulate data; we will then be introduced to Cloud concepts and Amazon Web Services.

In today's class, we will connect to Google Colab. Then, we'll learn about the basics of Pyspark, including how to read in data, store it in PySpark DataFrames, and perform transformations and actions on the DataFrames.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, we will be able to:

* Get up and running with Google Colab Notebook
* Understand how Spark works
* Store a dataset in a PySpark DataFrame
* Filter DataFrames
* Work with dates in data and plot results

## Instructor Notes

* The activities in this class will complement Lessons **16.1.1: What is Big Data?** through **16.4.3: Spark Functions**.  We will benefit from these activities if we‚Äòve progressed through these lessons, which cover the following concepts, techniques, and tasks:

* Big data overview
* Spark architecture
* Google Colab Notebooks
* Spark DataFrames and Datasets
* Spark transformations and actions
