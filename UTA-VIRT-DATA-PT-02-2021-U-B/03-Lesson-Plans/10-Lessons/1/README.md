# Module 10 Class 1: Mission to Mars - Web Scraping with HTML/CSS

## Overview

This week, we will be introducing web scraping. In this unit, you will first learn the basic setup of webpages with HTML and CSS. You will then learn how to use Beautiful Soup to navigate the HTML in order to scrape out the contents that they want. Then, you will expand on this skill by using the Splinter library to automate the process and store their results in a Mongo database.

In today's class, you will need to make sure that the web-driver manager is installed into their virtual environments. They can do so by running `pip install webdriver_manager` in their environment.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, you will be able to:

* Read HTML
* Scrape websites with Beautiful Soup
* Store scraped data in a Mongo database
* Automate scraping using Splinter
