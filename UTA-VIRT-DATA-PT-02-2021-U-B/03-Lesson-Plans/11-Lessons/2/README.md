# Module 11 Class 2: JavaScript Objects and DOM Manipulation

## Overview

In class, you will delve further into JavaScript as you learn to perform more sophisticated operations and data manipulation. Then, you'll learn how to manipulate the HTML DOM with `D3.js`.

The main areas of focus for today's class are to access, create, update, and iterate over JavaScript objects, use JavaScript to populate and filter data structures based on user input, and apply these changes to a webpage using the `D3.js` library to dynamically manipulate DOM elements.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, you will be able to:

* Use `forEach()` and callback functions
* Create, update, and iterate JavaScript objects.
* Understand the basic structure of a Bootstrap HTML table
* Use `D3.js` for basic DOM manipulation
* Populate and filter tables using static data structures
* Use D3 to attach events to DOM elements
* Dynamically manipulate the DOM through events
