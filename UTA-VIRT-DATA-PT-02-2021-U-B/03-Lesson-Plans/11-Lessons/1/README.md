# Module 11 Class 1: JavaScript Fundamentals

## Overview

This week, we will be introducing the JavaScript programming language. In this unit, you will learn how to use JavaScript objects and arrays, including how to store and retrieve their data.

In today's class, you will initialize variables and determine their data types, perform calculations, and use JavaScript functions and conditional statements to retrieve data from arrays and objects.  

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, you will be able to:

* Understand the basics of JavaScript
* Understand the different types of variables and objects in JavaScript
* Create and use JavaScript functions
* Convert JavaScript functions to arrow functions
* Use repetition and conditional statements

## Instructor Notes

* The activities in this class will complement Lessons **11.0.1: Creating Dynamic Content** through **11.4.2: Practice Using for Loops in JavaScript**.  You will benefit from these activities if you've progressed through these lessons, which cover the following concepts, techniques, and tasks:  

* Using the Chrome console.
* Initializing variables, `var`, `let`,`const`, and arrays
* Understanding array structure
* Understanding JavaScript objects
* Creating and using JavaScript functions
* Performing calculations using JavaScript
* Understanding and using arrow functions
* Using `for` loops

## Instructor Prep

* Welcome to JavaScript week! Since you have a strong background in Python at this point, the first part of the lesson moves quickly as it assumes basic programming knowledge. You will leverage their existing knowledge of Python to help grasp JavaScript fundamentals.

* Despite the syntactic similarities between Python and JavaScript, if you are encountering JavaScript for the first time then you may experience some initial discomfort.

  * Learning a new syntax can certainly feel like learning a whole new language, and that's exactly what we're doing! We don't expect you to be JavaScript masters! All of this information is iterative, and your skills will only improve with time and practice. If it becomes overwhelming, take advantage of office hours to spend time with the instructional staff to help get you moving in the right direction. Please don't be afraid to reach out for help! We are all here for your success.

* Some students may also wonder at some point how JavaScript relates to data analytics, especially those who are not interested in web development. JavaScript is a very powerful and marketable skill, so please consider it!

  * Learning how to build functional web applications with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript will open up a world of possibility for presenting our data! Many of the libraries that we will use for visualizations are JavaScript libraries, making it an essential skill for some of our more interactive visualizations.

* As you learn JavaScript, you'll find themselves needing to juggle a few tasks, including keeping track of code across multiple documents. You will likely experience some frustration. Again, you aren't expected to learn all of JavaScript in one week. Instead, this week will be a thorough introduction to the topic.
