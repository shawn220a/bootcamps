# Module 13 Class 2: Mapping GeoJSON Data

## Overview

In class, we will delve further into using the JavaScript library Leaflet to make dynamic and interactive maps. The main focus of today's class is accessing GeoJSON data from an external source, then iterating over the GeoJSON data and creating a dynamic, interactive map.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Use external GeoJSON data to populate a map
* Modify the layer controls to add interactivity to maps

## Instructor Notes

The activities in this class will complement Lessons **13.5.1: Overview of GeoJSON Data** through **13.6.5: Add a Legend to the Map**. You will benefit from these activities if youâ€˜ve progressed through these lessons, which cover the following concepts, techniques, and tasks:  

* Read GeoJSON data with the `d3json()` method
* Create maps from GeoJSON data with `L.geoJSON()`
* Access different types of geographical features in the GeoJSON file
* Use a `baseMaps` object to reference a base layer
* Create multiple overlays for our maps
