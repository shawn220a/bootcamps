# Module 13 Class 1: Creating Maps with Leaflet

## Overview

This week, we will be introducing the JavaScript library Leaflet. In this unit, you will use JavaScript and the `D3.js` library to retrieve coordinates from GeoJSON data and use the Leaflet library to plot geographical data on a Mapbox map through an API request.

In today's class, you will learn to render geographical maps and add interactive elements, including markers and circle markers that have varying radii based on the data.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, you will be able to:

* Use the Leaflet library with a Mapbox API key to create geographical maps
* Use the Leaflet library to add markers to a map
* Iterate through an array using JavaScript, and add data to a map
* Use layers and layer controls to add interactivity to maps

## Instructor Notes

* The activities in this class will complement Lessons **13.0.1: Visualizing Earthquake Data** through **13.4.3: Map Lines**.  You will benefit from these activities if you‘ve progressed through these lessons, which cover the following concepts, techniques, and tasks:  

* Creating a Mapbox API key
* Rendering a map on a local server
* Adding a marker to a map
* Adding circle markers to a map and modifying the radius
* Binding a popup with text to a marker
* Iterating through an array and creating markers for each object
* Adding two maps to a map using layer controls
* Using the Chrome console to troubleshoot

**Why is it useful to map out data geographically?**

Your datasets should be visualized and explained in ways that suit the data’s context and the interests of the stakeholders. Oftentimes, the geography of the data is highly relevant. For example, a marketing stakeholder would need to know about the popularity of their product in specific states to understand how to best move forward with their campaigns.
