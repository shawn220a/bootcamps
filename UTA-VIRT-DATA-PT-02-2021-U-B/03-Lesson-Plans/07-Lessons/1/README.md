# Module 7 Class 1: Getting Started with pgAdmin and SQL

## Overview

This week, we will be introducing a new programming language, Structured Query Language, or SQL. With SQL, students will learn to use the PostgreSQL management system to search for and retrieve data from a variety of tables in a pgAdmin database.

In today's class, we will make sure PostgreSQL and pgAdmin are installed correctly, then we’ll create a database, create tables in the database, import data into the tables from CSV files, and perform queries to retrieve data from the tables. 


## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, you will be able to:

* Verify that PostgreSQL and pgAdmin are installed correctly
* Create a database
* Import CSVs into database tables
* Perform simple queries
* Combine data using joins

## Instructor Notes

* The activities in this class will complement Lessons **7.0.1: Exploring Databases with SQL** through **7.3.3: Joins in Action**.  You will benefit from these activities if you've progressed through these lessons, which cover the following concepts, techniques, and tasks:  

* Create an ERD from CSV files
* Create a database on pgAdmin
* Create tables in a database using the ERD
* Import CSV files into database tables
* Create and run queries
* Use joins to combine records from two or more tables
* Create a new table from a query
* Export data from a table into a CSV file

### What's the relevance of PostgreSQL?
Databases will be crucial to your work as data professionals, and PostgreSQL, or Postgres, is a free, open-source object-relational database management system that is very popular in some data careers.
