# Module 5 Class 2: DataFrame Visualizations

## Overview

You will learn how to graph data from Pandas DataFrames after performing data munging operations to modify columns, remove missing data, fill in missing data, and group data into similar records to get sums and averages.

The main focus of today's class is graphing data from DataFrames. Today‚Äôs activities require the students to perform data munging tasks such as using `value_counts()`, `groupby()` with `count()`, `mean()`, and `sum()`, and the `loc[]` method to filter data before they create charts. Students will also be introduced to the `pivot()` and `resample()` functions, which will help them with the Challenge. The `resample()` function can order the time series data by hour, day, week, month, or year depending on the desired output to showcase the data in a chart.  

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, you will be able to:

* Create line, bar, pie, and scatter charts from Pandas DataFrames
* Add and modify chart features

## Instructor Notes

The activities in this class will complement Lessons **5.5.1: Get the Percentage of Fares for Each City Type** through **5.7.2: Pie Chart for the Percentage of Drivers for Each City Type**.  You will benefit from these activities if you've progressed through these lessons, which cover the following concepts, techniques, and tasks:  

* Use Pandas functions and methods on DataFrames
* Group data into similar records and perform calculations on the grouped data
* Filter a DataFrame based on a condition using logical operators
* Create pie and bubble charts
* Add and modify chart features

<strong>üì£  6.1 Instructor Do: Review </strong>

* Before ending class, review the skills that were covered today and mention where in the module these skills are used.
  * Plotting Pandas DataFrames and Series was covered in **Lesson 5.1.10**.
  * The `groupby()` function was covered in the previous module.
  * The `pivot()` and `resample()`functions were covered in the **06-Evr_BikeTrippin-Pivot_Resample** activity and will be needed to complete the Challenge.

* Please know that they should complete up to "Register for an API Key" in **Lesson 6.2.2 Get Started with OpenWeatherMap API** before next week so they don't have to spend time registering for an API key in class. In addition, this will allow you to participate in the activities that use the OpenWeatherMap API.
