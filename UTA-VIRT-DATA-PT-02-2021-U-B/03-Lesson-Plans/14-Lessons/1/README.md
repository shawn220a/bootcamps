# Module 14 Class 1: Creating Visualizations with Tableau

## Overview

This week, we will be learning how to visualize data stories with Tableau. In this unit, we will learn how to import data into Tableau, create basic visualizations, change data types of columns, join data sources, customize visualizations, create calculated fields, and create dashboards and stories.

In today's class, we will import Excel spreadsheets and CSV files into Tableau, then create basic visualizations, change data types of columns, join data sources, customize visualizations, and create calculated fields.  

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, we will be able to:

* Import data from various sources into Tableau.
* Create basic visualizations in Tableau.
* Customize their visualizations.
* Create custom calculations.

## Instructor Notes

* The activities in this class will complement Lessons **14.0.1: Tableau Basics** through **14.3.3: Find the Number of Rides by Gender**.  You will benefit from these activities if you‘ve progressed through these lessons, which cover the following concepts, techniques, and tasks:  

* Download and install Tableau Public
* Set up their Tableau environment
* Import data into Tableau and connect to a data source
* Change data types of columns and join data sources
* Understand how to use the data and analytics panes, and the “Marks” section
* Understand the difference between discrete and continuous measures
* Create pie, bar, and symbol marker charts
* Create a calculated field for gender

## Instructor Prep

* Welcome to Tableau week! Coding takes a back seat this week as the students focus on creating visualizations. While Excel and VBA allow you to be very flexible in how you manipulate your data, Tableau allows you to more easily discover visualizations you can apply to your data, even ones that aren’t readily available in Excel, like world maps.

* Tableau allows more flexibility when changing data sources or the type of charts you want to use. You can also add data and change scenarios on the fly without much overhead. The drag-and-drop abilities of Tableau make it incredibly simple to integrate more data (and it can handle **a lot** of data, more so than Excel).

* Different tools for different uses make it easier  to adapt and adjust to give your stakeholders what they need.

* We will be using the public version of Tableau. Although there is a 2-week free trial for Tableau Desktop, a lot of platforms do not extend student discounts or trials to students in continuing-education programs or those without university email addresses.

* Tableau Public is a free version of the software that provides all the same tools as Pro (Desktop). However, because it’s free, it requires all data that is input to be freely accessible, and it has a limit of 1 million rows. This version should not be used if you’re dealing with sensitive or privileged datasets. This version also does not allow saving to your machine, and you must save to their server.
