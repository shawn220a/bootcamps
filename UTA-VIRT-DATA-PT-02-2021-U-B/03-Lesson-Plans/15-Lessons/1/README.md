# Module 15 Class 1: The Fundamentals of R

## Overview

This week, we will be introducing the programming language R. In this unit, we will use R to perform data analysis, just like what we did with Python and Pandas; additionally, we’ll use R to perform statistical analysis.

In today's class, we will make sure R is installed correctly, then we'll review the basics of the R programming language, create vectors, use `for` loops, use `if-else` statements, identify substrings of strings, create functions, and organize data into tibbles &mdash; R’s version of data frames.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Verify that R and RStudio are installed correctly
* Understand the fundamentals of R programming
* Understand how to use RStudio
* Learn how to create and manipulate data in tibbles
* Compare and contrast the features of Python and R

## Instructor Notes

* The activities in this class will complement Lessons **15.0.1: Using Statistics and R to Boost Your Data Science Repertoire** through **15.3.7: Add Layers to Plots**.  We will benefit from these activities if we‘ve progressed through these lessons, which cover the following concepts, techniques, and tasks:  

* Understanding the basics of R programming
* Defining functions and using built-in functions
* Importing and reading files
* Using indexing and slicing to filter data
* Using arithmetic, relational, and logical operators
* Transforming, grouping, and reshaping data
* Plotting data using `ggplot()`


## Instructor Prep

**What is the relevance of R?**

R is a programming language for statistical computing that is commonly used in data analysis and data mining. It’s also used for its strength in creating visualizations.

You don’t need to walk away from this week with a mastery of R, but you will benefit from exposure to the core concepts of multiple languages and technologies throughout this course.
