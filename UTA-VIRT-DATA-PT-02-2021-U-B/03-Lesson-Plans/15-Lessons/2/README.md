# Module 15 Class 2: Statistical Analysis Using R

## Overview

In class, we will use R to perform hypothesis testing, one-sample and two-sample t-tests, ANOVA, linear regression and multiple linear regression, and A/B testing.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, you will be able to:

* Use one-sample and two-sample t-tests
* Use ANOVA
* Perform linear and multiple linear regression

## Instructor Notes

The activities in this class will complement Lessons **15.4.1: Identifying Statistical Test Types** through **15.10.1: Whose Analysis Is It Anyway?**. You will benefit from these activities if you‘ve progressed through these lessons, which cover the following concepts, techniques, and tasks:  

* Testing for qualitative and quantitative normality
* Understanding skewed distributions
* Understanding and applying the null and alternative hypotheses
* Generating a sample dataset using random sampling
* Applying one-sample and two-sample t-tests
* Applying ANOVA to compare means across two or more groups
* Understanding and determining the Pearson correlation coefficient
* Applying linear and multiple linear regression
* Applying chi-square for categorical data
* Understanding A/B testing
