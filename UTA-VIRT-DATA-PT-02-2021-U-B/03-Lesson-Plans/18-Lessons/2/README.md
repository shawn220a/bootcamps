# Module 18 Class 2: Principal Component Analysis and Hierarchical Clustering

## Overview

In class, we will learn about dimension reduction with principal component analysis (PCA) as well as an alternative to the K-means algorithm called hierarchical clustering.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, we will be able to:

* Understand how to reduce features or dimensions using PCA.
* Perform PCA on datasets.
* Use hierarchical clustering as alternative to K-means.

## Instructor Notes

* The activities in this class will complement Lessons **18.5.1: Dimensionality Reduction** through **18.6.4: K-means vs. Hierarchical Clustering**.  We will benefit from these activities if we've progressed through these lessons, which cover the following concepts, techniques, and tasks:

   * Dimensionality reduction
   * Principal component analysis
   * Mean, variance, and covariance
   * Linear transformations
   * Hierarchical clustering
   * Dendrograms
