# Module 18 Class 1: Introduction to Unsupervised Machine Learning

## Overview

This week, we will be introducing **unsupervised machine learning**. In this unit, we will learn about unsupervised learning and how it compares to supervised learning.

In today's class, we will learn how to process and prepare data for unsupervised models. We will then be introduced to the K-means algorithm.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, we will be able to:

* Understand how unsupervised learning compares to supervised learning
* Prepare and process data for unsupervised learning
* Apply K-means clustering
* Use the elbow curve to determine optimal cluster number

## Instructor Notes

* The activities in this class will complement Lessons **18.0.1: Using Unsupervised Learning to Discover Unknown Patterns** through **18.4.2: Use the Elbow Curve**. We will benefit from these activities if we‘ve progressed through these lessons, which cover the following concepts, techniques, and tasks:

* Supervised learning recap
* Executing Python files
* Unsupervised learning: transformation and clustering
* Preparing Data
* Preprocessing data with Pandas
* Data selection
* Clustering data
* The K-means algorithm
* Finding centroids
* Elbow curves
