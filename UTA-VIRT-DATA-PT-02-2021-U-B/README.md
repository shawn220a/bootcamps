## Online Class Norms

  1. Find the most quiet, distraction-free area in your home to begin class.
  2. The zoom link will become active at the start of optional office hours.
  3. Class instruction will begin on time or within a minute or two of the scheduled start time.  If you are late or absent, video recordings of class will be posted in BCS the day after class for your review.  The recordings will not include office hours content.
  4. Everyone’s video should always be on during class!
  5. You can use Zoom’s “Virtual Background” feature to mask visual background distractions.
  6. Share your screen during in-class activities.  
  7. If you have a question, please go off mute and ask!  Don’t be afraid to interrupt.  You can also click “Raise your hand” to get the instructor’s attention.  Your may prefer to type your questions in the Slack #01-class-activities channel.  You can also use Slack to privately DM the instructional staff with any questions.
  8. Office hours are optional and available for you to get one-on-one time with the instructional staff.  Take advantage of this, if you need help with homework or any material which is confusing to you.  You can choose to ask questions publically in the main room.  Or you can ask to spend time in a private breakout room

## Group Activity - Breakout Room Norms
  1. First, select someone to share their screen.  This person will be the “coder” for this activity.
  2. Second, make sure everyone in the group understands the activity’s instructions.
  3. Other group members will “Pair Program” by giving verbal guidance to the “coder”.
  4. The “coder” will not necessarily drive the activity.  Instead they will rely on guidance from the others in the group to complete the task.  The “coder” can initiate writing code independently after verbally explaining their intentions to the rest of the group.
  5. Instructional staff will bounce from between breakout rooms to check progress, answer questions, and offer guidance.
