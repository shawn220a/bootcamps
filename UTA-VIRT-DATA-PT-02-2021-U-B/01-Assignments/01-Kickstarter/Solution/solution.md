# Challenge Solution Grading Instructions

The objective of this challenge is for learners to practice using Excel functions covered in this module, apply a new function, `COUNTIFS()`, and practice creating visualizations.

Because this is the first challenge of the course, expect to see submissions of varying organization. Below are the key points to look out for as you work through each assignment.

## Deliverable 1: Outcomes Based on Launch Date

For the first deliverable, we are asking the learners to use their Excel skills and knowledge of pivot tables and graphing to visualize campaigns that were successful, failed, and canceled based on launch date.

The pivot table should be filtered to include only "theater" campaigns from the kickstarter data and should resemble the screenshot below.

## Deliverable 2: Outcomes Based on Goals

For the second deliverable, we are asking the learners to use a new Excel function, `COUNTIFS()`, that they have not used in this module or LLP. For this deliverable the learners will filter the Kickstarter data set using the `COUNTIFS()` function to get the number of projects that were successful, failed, and canceled projects based on the goal amount. Then, theyâ€™ll graph the percentage of successful, failed, and canceled projects based on the goal amount.

**Note:** Using and applying new functions and methods in any programming language is a common practice. To guide the students we will provide them with hints and links to examples as needed when asking them to use and apply a skill that was not covered in this module.

Once filtered to only include data for the "theater" category and "plays" subcategory in the `COUNTIFS()` function, the submission should resemble the screenshot below.

## Deliverable 3: Written Analysis of the Results

The goal of the writing assignment is for students to present their findings in a logical manner. Learners should use appropriate grammar and structure when writing. This is important because many students like to showcase their repositories on LinkedIn or on their resume for employers.

For the written analysis, learners should use the [README.md template](../Resources/Written_Report_Template.md) to write their report. The report will contain three sections: an overview of the project, analysis and challenges encountered, and results.

**Overview of Project:** Explain the purpose of this analysis.

**Analysis and Challenges:** Provide details of how you performed your analysis, using images and links to code, as well as any challenges you encountered, and how you overcame them.

**Results:** Answer the following questions in complete and coherent sentences.

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Theater Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

The README.md document should be in the home directory of their repository. All links should be working, and images should be formatted and displayed where appropriate.

## Solution File

The final solution, [KickstarterStats_Solved](KickstarterStats_Solved.xlsx), is provided for you to as a reference when checking learners' submissions.

Challenge workbooks should contain two additional sheets with charts: "Theater Outcomes by Launch Date" and "Outcomes based on Goals".

## Grading Rubric

The [Kickstarter Grading Rubric](../Resources/Kickstarter_Grading_Rubric.pdf) is provided for you to use when grading the learners' submissions.
