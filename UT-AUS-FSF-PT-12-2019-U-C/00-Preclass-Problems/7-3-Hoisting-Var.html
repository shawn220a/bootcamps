            Without running the code, determine what the following code will output and why:

            A: within the inner function variable a is hoisted to the top of the function. When 
            its hoisted its undefined. Then you attempt to increment "undefined" by 1 by doing a++. Hence you
            will get an error of NaN which stands for "Not a Number".
